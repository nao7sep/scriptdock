///
/// <para><b>Enter is a submit only when it is a real Enter.</b> A key consumed by the input method
/// arrives as <see cref="Key.ImeProcessed"/>, so an Enter that merely commits a candidate raises
/// nothing here. Single-line fields (<see cref="TextBox.AcceptsReturn"/> false) raise
/// <see cref="Submitted"/>; a multiline field (AcceptsReturn true) lets Enter insert a newline.</para>
///
/// <para><b><see cref="IsComposing"/> reports composition as state,</b> read from the presenter's
/// preedit buffer. A window-level command accelerator (Cmd/Ctrl+R and the rest) is a chord the IME
/// passes straight through — it never arrives as <see cref="Key.ImeProcessed"/> — so suppressing it
/// mid-composition needs this persistent flag, not the per-key signal above.
/// <see cref="IsFocusedElementComposing"/> is how the window asks the question once.</para>
