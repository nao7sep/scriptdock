/// <remarks>
/// This encodes the three close modes from the modal conventions:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>A direct user dismiss of a dialog that still has unsaved changes is intercepted
/// so the user can confirm losing the draft.</item>
/// <item>A commit close (Save/Apply) has already captured the user's intent, so it never
/// prompts.</item>
/// <item>Owner close, app shutdown, and OS session shutdown must never block: they take the
/// discard/no-op direction automatically and let the close proceed.</item>
/// </list>
/// Kept as a pure function so the close-mode policy can be tested without a UI thread.
