# run-built (launch the existing packaged app bundle without rebuilding) and
# rebuild (build and package a fresh bundle, then launch).
#
# On macOS, features gated by TCC (access to protected folders) need the
# ad-hoc-signed bundle from rebuild/run-built — `dotnet run` has no bundle
# identity, so those prompts won't fire here.
