/// 11.3.1 a window that loses the keyboard also drops its focused element (Avalonia PR 18990, issue

/// once the window is in front again. A window in front with nothing focused is left alone: keys
/// typed into it go nowhere, as before. macOS only: the defect is in Avalonia's macOS backend, and on
