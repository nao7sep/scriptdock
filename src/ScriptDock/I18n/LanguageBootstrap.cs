/// Two things have to happen this early. The first window's very first frame must already be in the
/// reader's language, and on macOS the items AppKit contributes itself — Services, Emoji &amp;
/// Symbols, Start Dictation — are drawn in the language it settles on when the application object is
/// created, which Avalonia does as it starts. So the language is resolved and handed to AppKit before
/// the app is built, from the saved preference read straight out of <c>config.json</c>.
///
/// The read is deliberately its own, and forgiving: the real store quarantines a file it cannot
/// parse, and that decision belongs to the app's startup path, not to a language lookup. A file that
/// cannot be read here simply means System, and the startup-failure surfaces then speak the
/// computer's language, which is what the localization conventions ask of them.
